		<h2>Past Projects</h2>
		<h3>Data-Driven Challange on Healthcare data</h3>
		<p>This Challange held by European Conference on Artifical Intelligence, the task is to report 30 and 60 minute prediction horizons of blood glucose level for each data contributor. We select 4 data-driven models, Multi-task RNN, DCNN, Reservoir, and Linear Regression.<br>
		The paper "Personalized Time Series Forecasting of Blood Glucose Levels" is submited for the competition.</p>
		<h3>Image Segmentation</h3>
		<p>There are two project associate with image segmentation. The first one is to identify the renal image for early diagnosis of Diabetes. The second one is to identify the disease explosion on region map. The method for both project is modified based on the U-net architecture. Both projects achieve approximate 97% accuarcy. </p>
		<h3>Interpretability Analysis for Random Forest</h3>
		<p>This project targets the interpretability of machine learning algorithms. Find prediction intervals, generate parameter ranking on sensitivity, and compute paramter significant levels and standard errors. We compare the causal forest and tranditional statistical methods, and draw conclusion that there is always a trade off between model accuracy and interpretablity.</p>
